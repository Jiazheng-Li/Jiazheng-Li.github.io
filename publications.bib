  abstract = {The intriguing properties of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted a lot of attention in photonics. Besides being effective in confining light in a counter-intuitive way, the correspondence between the near-field mode pattern and the far-field radiation of BICs manifests the fascinating topological characteristics of light. Early works on photonic BICs were mainly focused on designing artificial structures to facilitate their realization, while recent advances have shifted to exploring their exceptional properties in applications. In this review, we survey important breakthroughs and recent advances in this field. We detail the unique properties of BICs, including light confinement enhancement, sharp Fano resonances, and topological characteristics. We provide insights into the unique phenomena derived from BICs and the impact of BICs on various applications. We also discuss the paradigm shift enabled or facilitated by BICs in several emerging research frontiers, such as parity-time symmetric systems, higher-order topology, exciton-photon coupling, and moir\textbackslash 'e superlattices.},

  abstract = {Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted attention in photonics owing to their interesting properties. For example, BICs can effectively confine light in a counterintuitive way, and the far-field radiation of photonic structures that exhibit BICs has fascinating topological characteristics. Early research into photonic BICs was primarily focused on designing artificial structures to produce BICs. However, since the mid-2010s, exploring the potential applications of BICs has been a growing trend in research. In this Review, we detail the unique properties of BICs, including the ability to achieve enhanced light confinement, sharp Fano resonances and topological characteristics. We explore phenomena derived from BICs, including the generation of circularly polarized states and unidirectional guided resonances, and the impact of BICs on various applications such as lasing, nonlinear frequency conversion, waveguiding, sensing and wavefront control. We also discuss the insights provided by BICs in several emerging research frontiers, such as parity\textendash time symmetric systems, higher-order topology, exciton\textendash photon coupling and moir\'e superlattices.},

  abstract = {Degeneracy points in non-Hermitian systems are of great interest. While a framework exists for understanding their behavior in the absence of symmetry, it does not apply to symmetry-protected degeneracy points with reduced codimension. In this work, we investigate the braiding topology and non-abelian conservation rule of these symmetry-protected degenerate points. We find that, contrary to simple annihilation, pairwise created symmetry-protected degeneracy points merge into a higher order degeneracy point, which goes beyond the abelian picture. We verify these findings using a model Hamiltonian and full-wave simulations in an electric circuit system.},

  abstract = {Exceptional points (EPs) are special spectral singularities at which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become identical. In conventional wisdom, the coalescence of eigenvectors inevitably leads to the loss of completeness of the eigenbasis. Here, we show that this scenario breaks down in general at nonlinear EPs (NEPs). As an example, we realize a fifth-order NEP (NEP5) within only three coupled resonators with both a theoretical model and simulations in circuits. One stable and another four auxiliary steady eigenstates of the nonlinear Hamiltonian coalesce at the NEP5, and the response of eigenfrequency to perturbations demonstrates a fifth-order root law. Intriguingly, the biorthogonal eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian governing the system dynamics is still complete, and this fact is corroborated by a finite Petermann factor instead of a divergent one at conventional EPs. Consequently, the amplification of noise, which diverges at other EPs, converges at our NEP5. Our finding transforms the understanding of EPs and shows potential for miniaturizing various key applications operating near EPs.}

  abstract = {Exceptional points and skin effect, as the two distinct hallmark features unique to the non-Hermitian physics, have each attracted enormous interests. Recent theoretical works reveal that the topologically nontrivial exceptional points can guarantee the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is geometry-dependent, relating these two unique phenomena. However, such novel relation remains to be confirmed by experiments. Here, we realize a non-Hermitian phononic crystal with exceptional points, which exhibits the geometry-dependent skin effect. The exceptional points connected by the bulk Fermi arcs, and the skin effects with the geometry dependence, are evidenced in simulations and experiments. Our work, building an experimental bridge between the exceptional points and skin effect and uncovering the unconventional geometry-dependent skin effect, expands a horizon in non-Hermitian physics.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic topological theory of the scattering matrix and its submatrices, focusing on the singular values and vectors. We study the topological properties of the scattering matrix in the parameter space and determine a set of topological characteristics for a general system, including the winding number, Berry phase, and skew polarization. We reveal unique topological effects for a reciprocal system such as quantized single-band polarization and Z2 topology of Takagi vectors. Applying our theory, we reveal the topological nature of two phenomena: the well-known effect of coherent perfect absorption and a new effect we call coherent perfect extinction. Coherent perfect extinction refers to the complete extinction of light due to interference of multiple incident waves. It accounts for both absorption and scattering losses and encompasses many other known effects such as complete polarization conversion and reflectionless scattering modes, providing a unifying theme for these phenomena. Our analysis highlights the topological nature of these effects and provides criteria to localize their occurrence in parameter space, facilitating optical design to achieve these effects. We propose utilizing coherent perfect extinction for multichannel background-free sensing. These findings significantly advance our understanding of scattering phenomena and have important implications for the development of novel optical devices.}

  abstract = {Topological phases are greatly enriched by including non-Hermiticity. While most works focus on the topology of the eigenvalues and eigenstates, how topologically nontrivial non-Hermitian systems behave in dynamics has only drawn limited attention. Here, we consider a breathing honeycomb lattice known to emulate the quantum spin Hall effect and exhibit higher-order corner modes. We find that nonreciprocal intracell couplings introduce gain in one pseudospin subspace while introducing loss with the same magnitude in the other. In addition, nonreciprocal intracell couplings can also suppress the spin mixture of the edge modes at the boundaries and delocalize the higher-order corner mode. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian topological phases and bring in the spin degree of freedom in manipulating the dynamics in non-Hermitian systems.}
