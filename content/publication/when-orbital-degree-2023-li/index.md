abstract: The orbital degree of freedom (ODoF), which has a significant impact on
  exotic quantum states of matter and solid-state materials, has now been combined
  with higher-order topology. The experimental realization of a photonic p-orbital
  higher-order topological insulator can lead to exploring a wide range of novel topological
  phases involving the ODoF.
