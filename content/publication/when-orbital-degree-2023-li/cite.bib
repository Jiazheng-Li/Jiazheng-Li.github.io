 abstract = {The orbital degree of freedom (ODoF), which has a significant impact on exotic quantum states of matter and solid-state materials, has now been combined with higher-order topology. The experimental realization of a photonic p-orbital higher-order topological insulator can lead to exploring a wide range of novel topological phases involving the ODoF.},
