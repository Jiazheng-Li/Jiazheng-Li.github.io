abstract: Topological phases are greatly enriched by including non-Hermiticity. While
  most works focus on the topology of the eigenvalues and eigenstates, how topologically
  nontrivial non-Hermitian systems behave in dynamics has only drawn limited attention.
  Here, we consider a breathing honeycomb lattice known to emulate the quantum spin
  Hall effect and exhibit higher-order corner modes. We find that nonreciprocal intracell
  couplings introduce gain in one pseudospin subspace while introducing loss with
  the same magnitude in the other. In addition, nonreciprocal intracell couplings
  can also suppress the spin mixture of the edge modes at the boundaries and delocalize
  the higher-order corner mode. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian
  topological phases and bring in the spin degree of freedom in manipulating the dynamics
  in non-Hermitian systems.
