 abstract = {Degeneracy points in non-Hermitian systems are of great interest. While a framework exists for understanding their behavior in the absence of symmetry, it does not apply to symmetry-protected degeneracy points with reduced codimension. In this work, we investigate the braiding topology and non-abelian conservation rule of these symmetry-protected degenerate points. We find that, contrary to simple annihilation, pairwise created symmetry-protected degeneracy points merge into a higher order degeneracy point, which goes beyond the abelian picture. We verify these findings using a model Hamiltonian and full-wave simulations in an electric circuit system.},
