abstract: Degeneracy points in non-Hermitian systems are of great interest. While
  a framework exists for understanding their behavior in the absence of symmetry,
  it does not apply to symmetry-protected degeneracy points with reduced codimension.
  In this work, we investigate the braiding topology and non-abelian conservation
  rule of these symmetry-protected degenerate points. We find that, contrary to simple
  annihilation, pairwise created symmetry-protected degeneracy points merge into a
  higher order degeneracy point, which goes beyond the abelian picture. We verify
  these findings using a model Hamiltonian and full-wave simulations in an electric
  circuit system.
