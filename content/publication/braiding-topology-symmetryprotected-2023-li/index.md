abstract: The braiding topology in non-Hermitian systems, contributed by degeneracy points in the absence of symmetry, has sparked intense recent interest in exploring complex energy braiding in different disciplines. However, the interplay between this braiding topology and symmetries, especially those rendering the original framework inapplicable, remains elusive. Here, utilizing algebraic topology, we build the framework for the braiding topology of symmetry-protected degeneracy points, overcoming the challenges posed by the reduced codimension of these degeneracy points. The non-Abelian braiding topology is demonstrated with full-wave simulations in circuits. Our work empowers researchers across fields to harness symmetry and braid topology in non-Hermitian systems.
