 abstract = {Exceptional points and skin effect, as the two distinct hallmark features unique to the non-Hermitian physics, have each attracted enormous interests. Recent theoretical works reveal that the topologically nontrivial exceptional points can guarantee the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is geometry-dependent, relating these two unique phenomena. However, such novel relation remains to be confirmed by experiments. Here, we realize a non-Hermitian phononic crystal with exceptional points, which exhibits the geometry-dependent skin effect. The exceptional points connected by the bulk Fermi arcs, and the skin effects with the geometry dependence, are evidenced in simulations and experiments. Our work, building an experimental bridge between the exceptional points and skin effect and uncovering the unconventional geometry-dependent skin effect, expands a horizon in non-Hermitian physics.},
