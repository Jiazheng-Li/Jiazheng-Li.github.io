abstract: Exceptional points and skin effect, as the two distinct hallmark features
  unique to the non-Hermitian physics, have each attracted enormous interests. Recent
  theoretical works reveal that the topologically nontrivial exceptional points can
  guarantee the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is geometry-dependent, relating these
  two unique phenomena. However, such novel relation remains to be confirmed by experiments.
  Here, we realize a non-Hermitian phononic crystal with exceptional points, which
  exhibits the geometry-dependent skin effect. The exceptional points connected by
  the bulk Fermi arcs, and the skin effects with the geometry dependence, are evidenced
  in simulations and experiments. Our work, building an experimental bridge between
  the exceptional points and skin effect and uncovering the unconventional geometry-dependent
  skin effect, expands a horizon in non-Hermitian physics.
