abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted attention in photonics
  owing to their interesting properties. For example, BICs can effectively confine
  light in a counterintuitive way, and the far-field radiation of photonic structures
  that exhibit BICs has fascinating topological characteristics. Early research into
  photonic BICs was primarily focused on designing artificial structures to produce
  BICs. However, since the mid-2010s, exploring the potential applications of BICs
  has been a growing trend in research. In this Review, we detail the unique properties
  of BICs, including the ability to achieve enhanced light confinement, sharp Fano
  resonances and topological characteristics. We explore phenomena derived from BICs,
  including the generation of circularly polarized states and unidirectional guided
  resonances, and the impact of BICs on various applications such as lasing, nonlinear
  frequency conversion, waveguiding, sensing and wavefront control. We also discuss
  the insights provided by BICs in several emerging research frontiers, such as parity–
  time symmetric systems, higher-order topology, exciton– photon coupling and moiré
  superlattices.
