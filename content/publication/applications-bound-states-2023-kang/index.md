abstract: The intriguing properties of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted
  a lot of attention in photonics. Besides being effective in confining light in a
  counter-intuitive way, the correspondence between the near-field mode pattern and
  the far-field radiation of BICs manifests the fascinating topological characteristics
  of light. Early works on photonic BICs were mainly focused on designing artificial
  structures to facilitate their realization, while recent advances have shifted to
  exploring their exceptional properties in applications. In this review, we survey
  important breakthroughs and recent advances in this field. We detail the unique
  properties of BICs, including light confinement enhancement, sharp Fano resonances,
  and topological characteristics. We provide insights into the unique phenomena derived
  from BICs and the impact of BICs on various applications. We also discuss the paradigm
  shift enabled or facilitated by BICs in several emerging research frontiers, such
  as parity-time symmetric systems, higher-order topology, exciton-photon coupling,
  and moir 'e superlattices.
