abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are special spectral singularities at which two
  or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become identical.
  In conventional wisdom, the coalescence of eigenvectors inevitably leads to the
  loss of completeness of the eigenbasis. Here, we show that this scenario breaks
  down in general at nonlinear EPs (NEPs). As an example, we realize a fifth-order
  NEP (NEP5) within only three coupled resonators with both a theoretical model and
  simulations in circuits. One stable and another four auxiliary steady eigenstates
  of the nonlinear Hamiltonian coalesce at the NEP5, and the response of eigenfrequency
  to perturbations demonstrates a fifth-order root law. Intriguingly, the biorthogonal
  eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian governing the system dynamics is still complete, and
  this fact is corroborated by a finite Petermann factor instead of a divergent one
  at conventional EPs. Consequently, the amplification of noise, which diverges at
  other EPs, converges at our NEP5. Our finding transforms the understanding of EPs
  and shows potential for miniaturizing various key applications operating near EPs.
