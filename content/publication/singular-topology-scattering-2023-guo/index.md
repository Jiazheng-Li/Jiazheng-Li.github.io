abstract: 'We present a systematic topological theory of the scattering matrix and
  its submatrices, focusing on the singular values and vectors. We study the topological
  properties of the scattering matrix in the parameter space and determine a set of
  topological characteristics for a general system, including the winding number,
  Berry phase, and skew polarization. We reveal unique topological effects for a reciprocal
  system such as quantized single-band polarization and Z2 topology of Takagi vectors.
  Applying our theory, we reveal the topological nature of two phenomena: the well-known
  effect of coherent perfect absorption and a new effect we call coherent perfect
  extinction. Coherent perfect extinction refers to the complete extinction of light
  due to interference of multiple incident waves. It accounts for both absorption
  and scattering losses and encompasses many other known effects such as complete
  polarization conversion and reflectionless scattering modes, providing a unifying
  theme for these phenomena. Our analysis highlights the topological nature of these
  effects and provides criteria to localize their occurrence in parameter space, facilitating
  optical design to achieve these effects. We propose utilizing coherent perfect extinction
  for multichannel background-free sensing. These findings significantly advance our
  understanding of scattering phenomena and have important implications for the development
  of novel optical devices.'
