I am a physics master candidate at Wuhan University. I am working on condensed matter physics under the supervise of [Prof. Meng Xiao](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/mengxiao/en/index.htm), [Dr. Cheng Guo](https://cguo.org/), [Prof. FengCheng Wu](https://wufcheng.github.io/). My interests lie in studying emergent, topological, nonlinear phenomena in condensed matter systems and their potential applications analytically and numerically. I enjoy skiing, hiking, and reading.
